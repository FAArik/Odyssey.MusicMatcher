## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. Unlike REST APIs, where clients have to make multiple requests to different endpoints to fetch required data, GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need in a single query. This flexibility makes it efficient for client-server communication and enables faster development cycles.

## Why Hot Chocolate?

Hot Chocolate is a GraphQL server implementation for .NET and .NET Core. It is feature-rich, easy to use, and highly extensible. With Hot Chocolate, you can build GraphQL APIs using C# and leverage features like schema stitching, DataLoader integration, and more.

## What You'll Learn

By following this guide, you'll:

- Implement a GraphQL server using Hot Chocolate's annotation-based approach.
- Describe the journey of a GraphQL operation from client to server and back.
- Design a schema based on a UI mockup.
- Use an existing REST API as a data source.
- Utilize arguments in queries and resolvers.
- Learn best practices for queries and mutations in GraphQL.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you should have a basic understanding of:

- C# programming language
- .NET Core
- RESTful API concepts (optional)
